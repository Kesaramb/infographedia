# Infographedia — Version Roadmap (v1.0 → v2.0)

> From first working build to launchable product.

The 8 build iterations produce the **raw machinery**. This roadmap layers on the product refinement, user experience polish, growth mechanics, and launch readiness that turn working code into something people actually want to use.

---

## v1.0 — "It Works" (Build Iterations 1-15 Complete)

The output of the build iterations. Everything functions end-to-end:

- ✅ DNA renderer with **11 chart types** (bar, pie, line, area, donut, grouped-bar, stat-card, timeline, pictogram, vs-split, map-chart)
- ✅ **Animated infographics** via Remotion Player (30fps, 8s play-once with static swap)
- ✅ AI generation with **dual-tool grounding** (Qdrant knowledge base + web search)
- ✅ **Persistent AI knowledge base** — learns from every generation (Qdrant + Voyage AI embeddings)
- ✅ Infinite scroll feed with Framer Motion animations
- ✅ Iterate engine (fork + mutate + publish)
- ✅ Auth, profiles, search, comments
- ✅ Like/save/share with optimistic UI
- ✅ PNG export with branded footer
- ✅ Toast notification system
- ✅ **Admin-configurable AI pipeline** (model, temperature, tools, chart types, themes, few-shot examples, KB toggle)
- ✅ **Sticky generation engine** with engagement rules, hook field, and chart selection matrix
- ✅ Production deployment on HestiaCP with PM2
- ✅ Production build compiles (zero TypeScript errors)

**Status**: Feature-rich and technically complete. AI pipeline is production-ready with knowledge base for continuous learning. 11 chart types cover most data visualization needs. Ready for UX polish and growth mechanics.

## v1.1 — "It Feels Right" (UX Polish)

**Focus**: Make every interaction feel premium. First impressions matter — if the app feels janky, users leave before discovering the iterate engine.

### Deliverables

- **Micro-animations everywhere**
  - Like heart: scale bounce + fill animation
  - Save bookmark: subtle drop animation
  - Iterate button: shimmer/glow on hover
  - Modal open/close: spring physics (Framer Motion)
  - Feed card entrance: staggered fade-up on scroll
  - Toast slide-in from bottom with spring

- **Loading states that delight**
  - AI generation: animated DNA helix or morphing chart skeleton (not a spinner)
  - Feed skeleton: glass shimmer cards that pulse
  - Image loading: blur-up from thumbnail to full renderedImage

- **Haptic feedback** (mobile)
  - Subtle vibration on like, save, publish

- **Sound design** (optional, off by default)
  - Soft click on iterate
  - Chime on successful publish

- **Empty states**
  - Empty feed: "The canvas is blank. Create your first infographic." with prominent Create CTA
  - Empty profile: "No posts yet" with Create CTA
  - Empty search: "No results" with trending suggestions

- **Error states**
  - AI generation failure: friendly message + retry button, not a stack trace
  - Network offline: persistent banner with retry
  - Rate limit hit: "You're creating too fast. Try again in X minutes."

### Acceptance Criteria
- Every interactive element has a visible transition/animation
- Loading states are present for every async operation
- Zero raw error messages visible to users
- App feels responsive on a mid-range Android phone

## v1.2 — "The AI Gets Smarter" (Generation Quality)

**Focus**: Tune the AI pipeline until it produces consistently beautiful, accurate infographics. This is the difference between a tech demo and a product.

### Already Completed (Sprint 13-14)
- ✅ **Smart chart type selection** — AI selects from 11 chart types based on data shape (selection matrix in system prompt)
- ✅ **Knowledge base** — AI checks Qdrant for past research before web searching (faster, curated data)
- ✅ **Admin-configurable pipeline** — model, temperature, tools, chart types, themes, few-shot examples all editable from admin panel
- ✅ **Engagement rules** — title optimization, hook generation, chart selection matrix baked into system prompt
- ✅ **Few-shot examples** — configurable via admin panel (array of `{ label, dnaJson }`)

### Remaining Deliverables

- **Prompt engineering refinement**
  - Test 50+ diverse prompts, categorize failure modes
  - Add 3-5 curated few-shot examples via the admin panel
  - Tune the web search query construction (the AI often writes bad search queries)

- **Theme presets with visual identity**
  - Each `ThemeName` gets a full preset: not just colors, but font weight, border radius, spacing, background patterns
  - `glass-dark`: frosted dark with glowing edges
  - `neon-cyberpunk`: high contrast, gradient borders, monospace font
  - `minimalist`: thin lines, lots of white space, serif font
  - `editorial`: newspaper-style layout, muted tones
  - `warm-earth`: organic colors, rounded shapes
  - `ocean-depth`: deep blues, wave-like gradients

- **Data formatting intelligence**
  - AI formats numbers with proper units (3.2M, not 3200000)
  - Percentages when data is proportional
  - Currency symbols when financial
  - Date formatting for time series

- **Iteration quality**
  - When iterating, the AI preserves the visual coherence of the parent
  - Style iterations don't break data layout
  - Data iterations maintain the same chart type unless explicitly asked to change

### Acceptance Criteria
- 90% of prompts produce a visually coherent infographic on first try
- Generated data matches real-world sources (spot-check 20 prompts manually)
- Theme presets are visually distinct and polished
- Iterations feel like natural evolutions, not random regenerations
